  <li>I have studied control and instrumentation engineering, but all I want to be is a software engineer. I used my free time to practice everything I must have known about web development. It's very hard for me, but I still keep learning. Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who has shown interest in my GitHub profile.</li>
